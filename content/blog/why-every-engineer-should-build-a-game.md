Games force you to think in systems — and that's exactly what engineering is about.

## The Case for Game Development

When most people think of game development, they picture entertainment. But building a game — even a simple one — is one of the best exercises in systems thinking I've ever encountered.

As an industrial engineer, I spend my days thinking about processes, bottlenecks, and optimization. When I started building my first web game, I realized I was using the exact same mental models.

## What You Learn

- **State management** mirrors inventory and production tracking
- **Game loops** are just process cycles with different names
- **Balancing mechanics** is the same as line balancing on a factory floor
- **User feedback** is your quality control system

## Start Small

You don't need to build the next big thing. Start with something that models a system you already understand. For me, that was an assembly line simulator. For you, it might be something completely different.

The point isn't the game — it's the thinking.
